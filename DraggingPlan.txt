So here's the actual dragging mechanism:
When a terminal / connector is clicked on, a second mode activates - any stations the mouse then passes through is added to a trainline to connect in that order. If the mouse passes through in the reverse direction... it appears to disconnect (temporarily). releasing, of course cancels everything.
In this dragging mode,...
case terminal: a connector connects the last station on the generation queue to the current mouse. queue initiates at terminal's station. (it gets turned into temp)
case connector: a connector connects startStation with mouse and another with mouse with endStation. connected in queue stations get put after startStation and it becomes the new startStations.
case station: same as case connector, but disconnect station and form a connector with it's two neighbors. proceed as in connector
